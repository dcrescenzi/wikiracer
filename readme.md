### WIKIRACER ###

A quick little project that takes the work out of wiki races.  This was inspired by the many hours of fun wiki racing
gave me growing up.  The approach uses BFS to search outgoing page links to find the shortest path between any 2
wiki pages
\ \
To use, simply build by typing "make" into local terminal, followed by:\ \
**./wikiracer "/wiki/start" "/wiki/target"**

\ \
Have fun! I sure did while making it :)
